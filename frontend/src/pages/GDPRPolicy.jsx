            collect very minimal information (like name, email, and messages
            through the contact form). No fancy tracking, analytics, or
            marketing stuff is happening here yet.

            I care about protecting your personal data and aim to follow the
            principles of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as best
            as I can while I continue learning and improving this site.

            Your data (like contact form messages) is stored securely in the
            database. It is only used for the purpose of communication and is
            never sold or shared with third parties unless required by law.

          <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
            As this project grows, I plan to improve compliance by adding things
            like a cookie banner, clearer consent options, and easier ways for
            you to manage or delete your data.
